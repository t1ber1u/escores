Here are the reasons you can use as a QA engineer to explain why you don't need to test this:

As a QA engineer, I believe there is no need to test this change for the following reasons:

1. **No New Productive Code**: The update includes only an additional "test" for developers without any changes to the existing productive code.
2. **Developer Use**: The test is intended for developer convenience to check a physically USB connected mobile CT and is not part of the end-user functionality.
3. **Manual Verification Possible**: Developers can manually verify the functionality without the need for QA intervention, ensuring the test environment setup is correct.
4. **No Impact on Existing Functionality**: The new test does not impact existing features or functionalities, so it does not require regression testing.
