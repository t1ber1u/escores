Hi Artem,

I do have auto-formatting enabled through Prettier in my VSCode setup. However, the formatting issues you're seeing may have occurred after resolving a merge conflict. Sometimes, automatic formatting doesn't trigger during conflict resolution, so I'll make sure to manually format the code after resolving conflicts in the future to maintain consistency. Thanks for pointing this out!

Best,
