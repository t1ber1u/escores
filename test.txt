Sure, here's a formulation for your question to the architect:

Hi [Architect's Name],

I hope you're doing well. Our automated tests for TOTP authentication are currently failing when we run them in parallel. It seems that the tests are unable to authenticate with the TAN (Time-based One-Time Password). 

Could you please let us know if there have been any recent changes or security enhancements pushed to the CGM authentication solution that could be affecting this? Specifically, we're wondering if any new security enforcement has been introduced that might impact parallel authentication attempts.

Any insights you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
