Subject: Feedback on Bogdan Laculiceanu's Interview for Automation Role

Hi Cosmina,

I hope this message finds you well.

Thank you for considering my input regarding Bogdan Laculiceanu's interview for the Automation role on the EOS project. I appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback.

After the interview with Bogdan, I observed that he has a commendable level of experience in automation. However, it appears that he is more seasoned as a manual tester with some exposure to automation rather than being fully proficient and autonomous in automation tasks. 

For this role, I expected a candidate who could independently drive automation initiatives, bring extensive experience, and guide the project in the right direction to enhance the quality of the product. While Bogdan has shown some understanding and experience, he did not fully answer all my questions, which indicated a gap in the depth of his knowledge, particularly in areas beyond UI testing.

Given the needs of our project, I am concerned that he may miss opportunities to implement the necessary automation solutions effectively. Nonetheless, Bogdan's background and skills could be a valuable asset in a role that allows for further development and growth in automation.

I hope this feedback helps in making an informed decision. Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
