Here's the updated message with the additional PS:

Hi Team,

I've merged the latest changes into the develop branch, and I'd like to share some important updates and next steps:

1. **.env File Introduction**:
   - We've introduced a `.env` file for managing environment variables, which will be used for local authentication. This file **should not be committed to Git** for security reasons. I'll share the format and details separately. It helps secure automation and allows different CGM IDs at the project level. Update the variables with your local values.

2. **CI Environment Variables**:
   - For CI, masked variables have been added with default values (shared in the `.env` file). These can be overridden by adding the same variables with custom values during build runs. You can also schedule pipeline runs.

3. **Multi-Environment Testing**:
   - The capability to run tests against multiple environments is now available. By default, the tests run against `dev1`. To run against another environment, update the `URL` key in the `.env` file for local runs. For CI, customize the job and set the `URL` env var to your desired value.

4. **Tag-Based Filtering & Helpers**:
   - More details are available in the merge request description. This includes new tag-based filtering options and helper functions.

5. **Cookie Management**:
   - We've added cookie management functions, although they're not currently in use due to temporary session cookies. This might change later to use session cookies instead of TAN numbers.

**PS**: The tests are failing today due to an unexpected change or bug. It seems the expected authentication username is not found at the header level anymore. If anyone has information on this, please send an update. Once we clarify the situation, we can take appropriate actions and either raise a bug or update the tests.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask!

Best,  
Tiberiu Chiriac
