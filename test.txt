Hi team,

Just a heads up on a recent update I made:

- I've added a new folder `src/zephyr` containing a Jira API client, which was taken from another CGM automation project.
- Please note that the code hasn't been tested yet because we need a Jira service account for the API.
- I'm in the process of raising a ticket on the Alice platform to get this service account.
- This addition should not impact our tests at this stage.
- I'll run all tests in CI after committing the folder to ensure there are no adverse effects.
- Once we have the Jira service account, I will test the code, integrate it with our WebdriverIO framework, and push the test automation status results to our Jira tests.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out
