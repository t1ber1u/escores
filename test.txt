Here is the comment you can add to the Jira ticket:

---

I had a call with the developer of the Zephyr client and found out that this client is integrated directly into the Cypress automation project and is not developed as a package released for other projects to be used. I will extract the relevant code from his project and try to adapt and make it work on our WebdriverIO project. Additionally, I will need a separate Jira service account because the account used is for project level, and I cannot use their account.
