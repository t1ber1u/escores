Certainly! Here is the updated summary of the test automation concept, including the decision to follow the hybrid approach:

### Test Automation Concept for CGM

#### **Overview:**
- **Project:** Test Automation for Eden-fe Application
- **Architecture:** 
  - Language: TypeScript
  - Frameworks: WebdriverIO and Cucumber BDD
  - CI/CD: GitLab with Kubernetes pods
  - Repository: Shared with Eden-fe application code

#### **Development Environment:**
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode), free version
- **Version Control:** Git, following Git Flow for branching and merging
- **Code Reviews:** Required approval from at least one reviewer for merge requests

#### **Project Structure:**
- **Common Areas of Functionality:** General utilities and shared functions
- **Custom Locations per Project:** Subfolders such as Unity, Magna, Nexus

#### **Automation Framework:**
- **Wrapper:** A custom wrapper over WebdriverIO to enhance stability and functionality
- **Locators:** 
  - Use XPath and CSS locators
  - Prefer relative locators over full path locators when IDs are not available

#### **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Ensure paths and scripts are universal to support Windows, Linux, and MacOS

#### **Testing Strategy:**
- **Customer Bugs:** Automate to prevent recurrence
- **User Stories:** Automate at the user story level where possible
- **Execution:** 
  - Local environment for development
  - CI environment with tests filtered by team or run comprehensively

#### **Reporting:**
- **Output:** Standard BDD HTML reports
- **Distribution:** Reports sent via email post CI test runs

#### **CI/CD Integration:**
- Tests run in Kubernetes pods within the internal GitLab CI pipeline
- Unified process for running tests in different OS environments

### Chosen Approach: Hybrid
- **Hybrid Approach:** Only the crucial automation tasks are implemented by the developers themselves, while all other test cases are considered for follow-up automation done by the automation team. This approach ensures that automation is part of the user story and its definition of done but focuses on critical paths initially.

### Key Goals:
1. **Stability:** Enhance stability of UI tests through a custom WebdriverIO wrapper
2. **Cross-Platform Support:** Ensure scripts are compatible across multiple operating systems
3. **Efficiency:** Automate customer bugs and user stories to improve test coverage and quality
4. **Consistency:** Follow Git Flow for consistent version control and code integration
5. **Visibility:** Develop and implement email-based reporting for CI test runs

This comprehensive summary captures the essential aspects of your test automation strategy and includes the decision to adopt the hybrid approach for managing end-to-end and front-end test automation tasks.
