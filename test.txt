Hi Artem,

I appreciate your initiative in discussing the progress of e2e testing and the improvements in our QA processes. It's essential to address any challenges and work together to ensure a smoother workflow.

I would like to clarify a few points regarding our team's efforts. Significant progress has been made on several fronts, including setting up the CI platform, implementing authentication, and other crucial features. However, any perceived delay or lack of progress might stem from the fact that certain management decisions have delayed the process, and the lack of manual QA support has prevented us from identifying blockers before starting automation. The gentleman's agreement regarding our workflow hasn't been fully upheld by the management.

Additionally, there have been unfortunate implementations with blockers introduced both by our development team and other teams, such as DevOps and other development teams. These issues have further complicated the progress.

With respect, I also wanted to inform you that I have decided to resign from my position. This decision is not easy, but I believe it is the right step for me at this time. I wish the team and the company all the best in their future endeavors.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
