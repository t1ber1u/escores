### Pull Request: Implement TOTP Authentication

#### Description
This pull request introduces TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authentication, currently working against the `dev1` environment. The implementation is initial and may require further refactoring to address performance issues. 

#### Key Points:
- **Teams Involved**: Implemented for all teams: @magna, @unity, @nexus.
- **Environment**: Tested on MacOS and CI environments only. Windows users, please pull the `develop` branch and test the code on your machines.
- **User Implementation**: The implementation is abstract, allowing any user to be defined at the feature file level. It is recommended to use your own users for testing in feature files.
- **Session Handling**: The issue where subsequent scenarios in the same feature file failed authentication due to an existing session has been resolved. Now, if an authenticated session exists from a previous scenario, subsequent scenarios will not attempt to re-authenticate.

#### Next Steps:
- **Discussions Needed**: Further discussions are required to finalize the authentication implementation.
- **Testing and Feedback**: Windows users and other team members are encouraged to test and provide feedback.

Please note that this is the initial implementation and further refinements are expected.

Hi Team,

I have introduced TOTP authentication in our automation framework, now working against the `dev1` environment. This implementation has been added for all teams: @magna, @unity, @nexus.

**Key Points:**
- **Environment**: Currently tested on MacOS and CI environments. Windows users, please pull the `develop` branch and test the code on your machines.
- **User Implementation**: Abstract implementation allowing user definitions at the feature file level. I recommend using your own users for testing in feature files.
- **Session Handling**: Resolved the issue where subsequent scenarios in the same feature file failed due to an existing authenticated session. Now, if a session exists from a previous scenario, subsequent scenarios will not re-authenticate.

This is the initial implementation, and further discussions and refinements are expected. Please provide feedback and test on your respective environments.

Thanks!
