Certainly! Here is the updated summary of the test automation concept, including the unique capability added for browser version management:

### Test Automation Concept for CGM

#### **Overview:**
- **Project:** Test Automation for Eden-fe Application
- **Architecture:** 
  - Language: TypeScript
  - Frameworks: WebdriverIO and Cucumber BDD
  - CI/CD: GitLab with Kubernetes pods
  - Repository: Shared with Eden-fe application code

#### **Development Environment:**
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode), free version
- **Version Control:** Git, following Git Flow for branching and merging
- **Code Reviews:** Required approval from at least one reviewer for merge requests

#### **Project Structure:**
- **Common Areas of Functionality:** General utilities and shared functions
- **Custom Locations per Project:** Subfolders such as Unity, Magna, Nexus

#### **Automation Framework:**
- **Wrapper:** A custom wrapper over WebdriverIO to enhance stability and functionality
- **Locators:** 
  - Use XPath and CSS locators
  - Prefer relative locators over full path locators when IDs are not available

#### **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Ensure paths and scripts are universal to support Windows, Linux, and MacOS

#### **Testing Strategy:**
- **Customer Bugs:** Automate to prevent recurrence
- **User Stories:** Automate at the user story level where possible
- **Execution:** 
  - Local environment for development
  - CI environment with tests filtered by team or run comprehensively

#### **Reporting:**
- **Output:** Standard BDD HTML reports
- **Distribution:** Reports sent via email post CI test runs

#### **CI/CD Integration:**
- Tests run in Kubernetes pods within the internal GitLab CI pipeline
- Unified process for running tests in different OS environments

### Chosen Approach: Hybrid
- **Hybrid Approach:** Only the crucial automation tasks are implemented by the developers themselves, while all other test cases are considered for follow-up automation done by the automation team. This approach ensures that automation is part of the user story and its definition of done but focuses on critical paths initially.

### Unique Capability:
- **Browser Version Management:** The automation project can run on any desired Chrome browser version both locally and in CI. A capability to install any version of Chrome and the corresponding ChromeDriver version has been added. Additionally, the installation of Firefox or other browsers can be done if needed. This flexibility avoids limitations associated with using a hardcoded browser version and enhances coverage and capability. Dedicated Chrome browsers built for automation by Google are utilized.

### Key Goals:
1. **Stability:** Enhance stability of UI tests through a custom WebdriverIO wrapper
2. **Cross-Platform Support:** Ensure scripts are compatible across multiple operating systems
3. **Efficiency:** Automate customer bugs and user stories to improve test coverage and quality
4. **Consistency:** Follow Git Flow for consistent version control and code integration
5. **Visibility:** Develop and implement email-based reporting for CI test runs
6. **Flexibility:** Provide the capability to run tests on any Chrome browser version, enhancing test coverage and adaptability.

This comprehensive summary now includes the unique capability for browser version management, which significantly enhances the flexibility and coverage of your test automation framework.
