feat: Add Jira API client to src/zephyr

- Added a new folder `src/zephyr` with a Jira API client taken from another CGM automation project.
- Note: The code hasn't been tested yet due to a missing Jira service account needed for the Jira API.
- Currently working on raising a ticket on the Alice platform to obtain this service account.
- This commit should not impact our tests at this point.
- All tests will be run after committing this folder in CI to ensure no impact.
